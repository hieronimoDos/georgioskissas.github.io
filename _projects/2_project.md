We provide a structured pipeline for creating vascular trees inside a perfusion volume in the brain by performing Constraint Constructive Optimization and simulating by employing a Reduced Order Navier-Stokes model. We provide an end-to-end framework that can manipulate well established brain geometry databases, i.e. the BraVa database, create trees in chosen areas of the brain, and incorporate patient specific inlets based on MRI measurements to create a tool for simulating the blood flow in the inter-cranial area and provide information about the pressure, velocity and volumetric flow inside the brain.
