I am a fifth year doctoral candidate in the department of [Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics](https://www.me.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania supervised by [Dr. Paris Perdikaris](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h_zkt1oAAAAJ&hl=en). I am also affiliated with [Penn Institute of Computational Sciense (PICS)](https://pics.upenn.edu/). Before coming to Penn I worked with [Dr. Doros Theodorou](http://comse.chemeng.ntua.gr/dntpage.html) at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/) on the computational study Self-Consistent Field Theory for polymer interfaces.


My work focuses on precision medicine and more specifically in synthesizing Artificial Intelligence (AI), Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and medical imaging (US/MRI) techniques to provide trustworthy predictions for early diagnosis of diseases with no strong genetic predisposition, like Hypertensive Pregnancy Disorders. I have developed both data-driven and physics informed machine learning methods for this purpose. My latest focus is on combining operator learning with CFD for predicting disease indicators for individual patients in a real-time clinical setting.
